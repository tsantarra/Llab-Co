    POMDP solvers
<<<<<<< HEAD
        MCTS
        DONE VI      -> mostly just work on state distributions rather than states, oh, and update future beliefs....

    MCTS
        Adjust traversal to save simulation time.
            Node should keep:
                transition probs
                distributions to child nodes via actions?
=======
        THTS -> get MDP version implemented first
        VI      -> mostly just work on state distributions rather than states, oh, and update future beliefs....

    MCTS
        Implement THTS as favored version
>>>>>>> 054a371121c505c3be032e29abcc838a699e2aa9
        Add support for rollout heuristics

    Domains
        Small - rendezvous?
        Cops and Robbers
        DONE - Tiger
        StarCraft

    Plan-space reasoning
        Expectation over tree
        Comm evaluation

    Models - for agents
        Belief distribution

        Barrett model?
        SC build orders or other learning?

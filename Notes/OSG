TODO:
    create virtual env should pip install necessary packages for us, which is why we do it at OSG but before sending
    to compute nodes (which probably can't install packages)


Process outline:

    [LOCAL] fabfile - Runs remote commands on OSG system.
    |
    |-- pull repository
    |
    |-- create virtual environment (create_virtual_env.sh)
    |
    |-- tar and remove repo python code
    |
    |-- make log directory
    |
    |-- [OSG] call condor submit script (osg_setup.submit)
    |                       |
    |-- collect output      |-- specify transfer files (virtual env, project, run script)
                            |
                            |-- set up pc requirements for jobs
                            |
                            |-- [COMPUTE NODE] specify run script (run_remote_test.sh)
                            |                   |
                            |-- setup args      |-- decompress virtual environment, python project
                                                |
                                                |-- make output directory
                                                |
                                                |-- run python file (experiments/test_run)
                                                |
                                                |-- tar the output for returning

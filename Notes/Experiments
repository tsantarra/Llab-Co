    Parameters

        Find best:
            Plan iterations per step (find best)
            Comm iterations per step
            Number of trials at each param config  (test)
            Comm branching factor

        Vary for experiments:
            Choice of domain
            Comm Heuristic
            Comm Cost
            Number of policies seen (varies by design)
            Generating distribution over teammate policies?


        2-3 domains
        ~6 heuristics
        3 comm costs?
        5 numbers of policies seen
        2 distributions?
    --------------
        540 combinations x 100 trials each = 54,000
        @20 minutes per trial over 100 computers -> 15 days

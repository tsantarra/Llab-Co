    Paper notes:
        - Search through hypothesis space. V subset of H - version space - set of hypotheses which are
            consistent with the observed data. See Burr Settles stuff on active learning.
        - Similar to minimizing expected error of prediction (forward looking through queries), but with a diff objective function
        - Noa Agmon leading paper -> task is to find the best possible REACHABLE joint actions/plans
        - Definition of problem
            - decentralized MDP variant
            - the modeler's view (planning in world state x modeling space) / POMDP
                - focus on planning while learning, otherwise only vaguely justified
            - active vs passive learning
            - active learning in ad hoc teams -> sharing policy information
            - planning for active learning -> planning over policy knowledge
            - optimize not for prediction accuracy, but for utility maximization
            - applications within teams of multiple unknown agents
        - Theoretical aspects
            - conditions where policy sharing is necessary
            - combinatorial space
            - MDP structure
            - DAG
            - early termination
            - cost effect? - free comm -> perfect info -> perfect policy
            - not submodular; matroids don't help
                - I'm not sure this is correct anymore, now that we've updated VOI calculations to be a delta
                - Alternatively, the submodular function could be the optimistic info gain left, given a subset of queries

                - interactive submodular set covering (interactive -> need a stochastic response)
                    - some guarantees on greedy algorithm -> Interactive Submodular Set Cover - Guillory and Bilmes
                    Interactive submodular set cover cannot be approximated within a factor of (1 − ǫ) max(ln |H|, ln α) in
                    polynomial time for any ǫ > 0 unless NP has n^{O(log log n)} time deterministic algorithms




    Active learning:
        - Fisher information? - dependent on model parameters (which we're not using a parameterized model)
        - Query by committee
            - useful for set of prior models
            - also works on N best (most likely) sequence labelings (using model predictions, generate the top most likely outcomes, use that as committee)

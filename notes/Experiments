    Goals:
        Things to show:
            Fewer trials BEFORE identifying optimal joint policy
            Better performance with novel teammate policy
            Better performance WHILE gaining experience

            Comm cost suppresses comm effectiveness (duh)
            More comm iterations -> better results, but slow execution time
            More comm branching factor -> better comm strategy, but shallower or more time

            Domain plays an important role (if set up for informative observations or few optimal policies)
            Experience helps (the more, the better)
            Heuristic matters (uncertainty AND risk are at play)



        Domain-specific knobs (hard to control):
            Few observations before critical choice
            No observations at all (teammate working in unobservable room? prisoner's dilemma-ish)
            Uninformative observations until late
            New part of state space (prior experience unhelpful)
                - this can be done easily with highly varied initial state

        Comm hurdles:
            Number of states with critical choices -> more = more comms (potentially, depends on num optimal policies)
            Number of optimal policies -> more = more comms


        Potential domains:
            Pursuit (boring)
            Bandits (not great)
            Soccer (hard to implement)
            Navigation/collision avoidance (common)
            Cooperative box-pushing?
            3x3 meetup
            Economic games? (like repeated prisoner's dilemma)



    Parameters

        Find best:
            Plan iterations per step (find best)
            Comm iterations per step
            Number of trials at each param config  (test)
            Comm branching factor

        Vary for experiments:
            Choice of domain
            Comm Heuristic
            Comm Cost
            Number of policies seen (varies by design)
            Generating distribution over teammate policies? (probably best for a stretch goal)


        2-3 domains
        ~6 heuristics
        3 comm costs?
        5 numbers of policies seen
        2 distributions?
    --------------
        540 combinations x 100 trials each = 54,000
        @20 minutes per trial over 100 computers -> 15 days


        2 domains
        1 underlying teammate distribution (sample from optimal; fix alpha in CRP)
        5 experience pre-trial
        1 size of coordination policy (fix)
        1 size of communication policy (fix)
        3 branching factor of comm policy
        10 comm heuristics
        3 comm costs

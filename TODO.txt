BY PRIORITY (ISH)

    Cops and Robbers:
        Node values are commonly > 100
        Timing -> too much time pruning?

    Restructuring
        Agent's perspective
            - heuristic
            - backup function
            - partial observability

    POMDP wrapping into MDPs
        Successful, however
            - No connection to "actual" state, just sampled a possible belief state
            - No recording of observations
            - Not yet clear on how to plug in multigent model; may just have to be an interesting exercise.

    Domains
        Small - rendezvous?
        Cops and Robbers
        StarCraft

    Plan-space reasoning
        Comm evaluation
        Comm planning

    Models - for agents
        Belief distribution
        Naive frequentist
        Barrett model?
        SC build orders or other learning?

    Documentation
        Use docstring convention from Google ( https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html# Comments )
        Can be set by PyCharm in settings, tools, python integrated tools, docstring format


Nice to have, but completely beyond the scope of the current project.
    Tree Visualizations

    Tree/graph abstraction for all solvers (fits a generic visualization framework too!)

    Profiling and unit tests

    Debug
        - use logging module http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2012/04/06/stop-using-print-for-debugging-a-5-minute-quickstart-guide-to-pythons-logging-module/

    Async
        - far advanced, but consider doing something concurrent
        - use coroutines via new asyncio features in python?

    Authoring - POMDP file input

    Hierarchical Graph Reduction
        Epsilon merging
        Multi-level graph partitioning

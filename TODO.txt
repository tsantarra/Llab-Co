BY PRIORITY (ISH)

    Restructuring
        Agent's perspective
            - heuristic
            - backup function
            - partial observability

    POMDP wrapping into MDPs
        Successful, however
            - No connection to "actual" state, just sampled a possible belief state
            - No recording of observations
            - Not yet clear on how to plug in multigent model; may just have to be an interesting exercise.

    Domains
        Small - rendezvous?
        Cops and Robbers
        StarCraft

    Plan-space reasoning
        Comm evaluation
        Comm planning

    Models - for agents
        Belief distribution
        Naive frequentist
        Barrett model?
        SC build orders or other learning?

    Documentation
        Use docstring convention from Google ( https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html# Comments )
        Can be set by PyCharm in settings, tools, python integrated tools, docstring format


Nice to have, but completely beyond the scope of the current project.

    Authoring - POMDP file input

    Hierarchical Graph Reduction
        Epsilon merging

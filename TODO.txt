BY PRIORITY (ISH)

    Fewer classes
        Rule of thumb: if class has only one or two functions, don't use a class. See almost everything in managers.
        More modules with imported functions that operate on structures (trees), like C
        Less inheritance

    MCTS
        Add support for rollout heuristics

    Plan-space reasoning
        Find abstraction for MCTS, fh-VI, bfs(?)
        Expectation over tree
        Comm evaluation
        Comm planning

    Domains
        Small - rendezvous?
        Cops and Robbers
        StarCraft

    Models - for agents
        Belief distribution
        Naive frequentist
        Barrett model?
        SC build orders or other learning?

    Tests
        Profile - test runtimes

    Documentation
        Use docstring convention from Google ( https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html# Comments )
        Can be set by PyCharm in settings, tools, python integrated tools, docstring format


Nice to have, but completely beyond the scope of the current project.

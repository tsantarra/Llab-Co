BY PRIORITY (ISH)

    DECORATE THE PLANNER COMPONENTS FUCK

    Restructuring
        Agent's perspective
            - multiagent scenario wrapper?
                States need turns
                Every transition should update the agents
                The planner needs to consider future models, then (wrap into state POMDP style?)


    Domains
        StarCraft

    Plan-space reasoning
        Comm evaluation
        Comm planning

    Visualization
        Improving x coordinates never improves overall structure.

    Cython
        MDP planner (thts_dp)
        Domain scenarios

    Models - for agents
        Barrett model?
        SC build orders or other learning?

    Documentation
        Use docstring convention from Google ( https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html# Comments )
        Can be set by PyCharm in settings, tools, python integrated tools, docstring format


Nice to have, but completely beyond the scope of the current project.
    Tree/graph abstraction for all solvers (fits a generic visualization framework too!)

    Profiling and unit tests

    Debug
        - use logging module http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2012/04/06/stop-using-print-for-debugging-a-5-minute-quickstart-guide-to-pythons-logging-module/

    Multiprocessing
        - far advanced, but consider doing something parallel

    Authoring - POMDP file input

    Hierarchical Graph Reduction
        Epsilon merging
        Multi-level graph partitioning
